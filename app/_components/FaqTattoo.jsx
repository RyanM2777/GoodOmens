      <div class="px-6 pb-6 text-black">You may bring someone with you to your appointment, however they may not be permitted into the tattoo area. This is for several reasons: <br /> <br /> Due to health and safety- during the procedure we are dealing with bodily fluids and essentially open woulds- we need to minimise the risk of contamination. The dignity of our customers- for some tattoos our customers are required to adjust their clothing and discretion is required. Busy studio- if the studio is busy there may simply not be room for your friend to come along! <br /> <br /> Some exceptions may be permitted, let us know before coming to your appointment. We politely remind customers that our studio is not child friendly, no children are permitted in the main studio and we ask that they are not in the reception area for any extended period of time. We are not babysitters and take no responsibility for children left unattended.</div>

      <div class="px-6 pb-6 text-black">Please except your design 24-48hrs before your appointment- this is standard practice for most artists and studios. Without an appointment and a deposit, the artist is essentially working for hours for free. They must create multiple designs for every day they work- these are usually done in their free time, in order and a day or two prior to the appointment (this saves them wasting time over rescheduled or canceled appointments) We have also in the past had customers take the design and tattooed elsewhere- stealing that persons work.</div>

      <div class="px-6 pb-6 text-black">Please do not shave or wax the area for 4 days prior to the procedure. We will shave the area on site immediately prior to the tattoo. This is to lessen the likelihood of razor rash, ingrown hairs and cuts- if these were present on the tattoo area we may not be able to tattoo you. Please also do not apply fake tan close to your appointment or soon after - this can have a huge effect on the colour of your finished tattoo and lead to it healing very differently. </div>
